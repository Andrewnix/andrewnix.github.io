			<p class="paragraph1">The music industry has been shaken up in unforeseen ways by the COVID-19 pandemic and it has had a negative impact on the livelihoods of many.
				Despite the virus’ origins in China, America quickly became the new epicenter for the virus once cases began showing up. Industries all across the country have been financially impacted as a result.
				Massive record labels and famous artists have mostly been unaffected by the virus, however smaller musicians, labels and venues all across the country are suffering. 
				Realistically, musicians only have two options for revenue. Those options being live performances and touring and then selling recorded music. Touring is the much more lucrative option, especially for smaller musicians, but it’s been compromised by the outbreak.

<p class="paragraph2">Streaming services have made accessing and listening to music much more convenient than going to a record store and buying physical copies. However, this convenience for the listener comes at a cost for artists that have smaller followings and may not be signed to a label.</p>

<p class="quote1">“U.S. musicians only take home <i>one-tenth</i> of national industry revenues. One reason for such a meager percentage is that streaming services, while reinvigorating the music industry at large, aren’t lucrative for artists”</p>
<p class="attribution1"><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/pro/features/how-musicians-make-money-or-dont-at-all-in-2018-706745/"> -Amy Wang </a> in an article published to Rolling Stone.</p>
<br>

<p class="paragraph2"> Musical releases have been delayed due to many artists being unsure what the near and distant future have in store for the music industry. 
<b>“Post-pandemic outlook appears challenging and growth forecasts for live music are expected to be revised significantly... one survey shows that, without a proven vaccine, less than half of US consumers plan to go to concerts, movies, sports events and amusement parks when they reopen. This will affect artists hugely – they generate around 75% of their income from live shows, even as data shows that a growing share of live music revenue goes to the top 1% of performers (60% in 2019, versus 26% in 1982),”</b> said Stefan Hall in an article published to the World Economic Forum.</p>

			<p class="paragraph4">Musicians are regular people too who provide us with a universal form of art appreciated around the world by all cultures and there are plenty of ways one can go about supporting a musician or scene that they are a part of.
			Social media has gifted us with a type of interconnectivity that was previously unheard of. Plenty of musicians have been using it to their advantage as a tool to better engage with their fans during this time period where everyone is advised to stay indoors and avoid large crowds.
			Bandcamp, a popular music streaming service, has been waiving revenue shares for artists with music on their platform once a month to help out with “rents, mortgages, groceries, medications, and so much more.”
			<b>$4.3 million</b> was spent on music and merch the first time Bandcamp did this on March 20, and they’ve had similar numbers with every subsequent waiver with <b>$7.1 million</b> made from the May 1 waiver and <b>$4.8 million</b> made from the June 5 waiver.
			Seattle-based rock band <a href="https://minusthebear.bandcamp.com/">Minus The Bear</a>, who disbanded in late 2018, keeps  a presence on their social media and has been using Bandcamp’s monthly revenue waivers to sell their music. 
			All the money made gets donated to support different organizations, such as Black Lives Matter, particularly when the protests over George Floyd were at their peak.</p>

			<p class="paragraph5">On a local level, there are various student-run groups through the University of Maryland that have brought both student and non-student musicians together to support each other.
			Terrapin Record Label hosts weekly zoom meetings and instructional workshops on writing, recording and releasing music and also how to market your music during a pandemic.
			<b>“Having your own website is super helpful because it shows a lot more of what your creativity is, it shows that you are able to figure out better ways to market yourself too,”</b> said Nick Arnold.
			Arnold is a UMD graduate and the founder of Terrapin Record Label and spoke at a zoom meeting for the organization on November 15.
			Some other content that TRL is putting out to help musicians during the pandemic includes instructional zoom workshops and content on the label’s Instagram page created by members to help support other musicians who may be struggling during the pandemic.</p>
