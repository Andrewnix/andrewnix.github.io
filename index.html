			<p class="intro">I'm Andrew Nixon, a journalism student at the University of Maryland, College Park. This is my online portfolio where you can find out information about my work experience as a student.</p>
			<p class="intro">Aside from being a student, I am also currently employed by the university's Library Media Services where I have been working as a student assistant since June 2019. For my job, I have helped with creating online modules to instruct undergraduate students, graduate students and even professors on how to use different software with the Adobe Creative Suite. The experience I have gained as a student assistant has been invaluable and I want to bring that experience with me as I enter the professional world and look to begin my career.</p>

Each workshop has videos that take you step by step in the process from importing to exporting and I'm proud of the way I've been able to create content that not only made me better at using this software but can also educate others on how to use it too.</p>
